# Public Gist Viewer:

## To run project: 

###

    1. clone repo
    2. in '/beginning-of-repo' run %npm install to download necessary node_modules. Otherwise, feel free to download them individually with '%npm install {node_module}' . In case I did not --save when I was installing them, this may be necessary.

    4. npm run start 

### Notes/Comments

Project to view gists that are mocked in the db.json file. There are three pages: Home, GistTable, and Detail. Given the really short 2hr time frame I'm glad I was able to get the basic functionality down. I would've liked to show off more of my strengths like UX and design, but again given the time frame and the fact that css was not at all the focus, I prioritized functionality over everything. I would've also liked to include some unit tests, add/delete/edit functionality, authentication, etc. and will likely use this project to practice some of those things in the very near future. A little stressful two hours, but I'm happy with where I was able to get. Thank you for the opportunity!
